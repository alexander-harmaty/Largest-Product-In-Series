# ProjectEuler8_Largest-Product-in-a-Series

This project was an assignment taken from Project Euler for my Discrete Structures class (CSC-251) at Farmingdale State College.

Much like other coding educational tools such as LeetCode, Project Euler provides users with coding prompts to practice their programming skills.
Where Project Euler differs is by challenging users with mathematical and computer programming problems that require a combination of mathematical insights, computer skills, and programming knowledge to solve.
The assigned prompt was question 8, where I was to find the thirteen adjacent digits in the provided 1000-digit number that have the greatest product, and to provide the value of this product.

My program finds the solution to this problem in multiple ways, and prompts the user to select their desired method of drawing an answer.
The first option finds the thirteen adjacent digits solution from the given 1000 digit number. 
The second option finds the solution to the user input number of adjacent digits from a randomly generated number consisting of a user input number of digits. 
The third option finds the solution to the user input number of adjacent digits from digits read within a user selected file. 
In all options listed, the program will provide the solution by highlighting the adjacent numbers in red, then show the value of their product below. 

This project was made with C++ and finds a solution within an O(n) processing time.
